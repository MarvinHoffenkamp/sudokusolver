# Sudoku Solver
A little sudoku solver program i wrote for a coding challenge

Roughly implemented the backtracking algorithm from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms)

### Possible improvements
- Dynamically build playing field.
- Randomize input values
- Re-use solver without reloads between puzzles
